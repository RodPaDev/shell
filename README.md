## C Shell

Followed Stephen Brennan's tutorial found [here](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)

What I learned
- Basic C syntax
- Intro to pointers?
- How to include libraries
- Data types
- Single quotes & double-quotes have different meanings
  - Single quotes identify single characters `'a'`
  - Double quotes create a string literal `"a" = ['a', null]`

What I didn't learn
- How to write a shell

The reason I didn't learn it, is because there are many parts of the shell that I'm so new to, this is was my first introduction to C and quite a fun one.  
I used this mainly to learn C syntax and not to learn how to write a unix shell.
